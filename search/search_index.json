In logic and linguistics, a metalanguage is a language used to make statements about statements in another language (the object language). Expressions in a metalanguage are often distinguished from those in an object language by the use of italics, quotation marks, or writing on a separate line. The structure of sentences and phrases in a metalanguage can be described by a metasyntax. - Wikipedia General purpose Xtend: https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/ Grammar declaration Semantics declaration Books The Software Languages Book - Syntax, semantics, and metaprogramming : http://www.softlang.org/book Engineering Modeling Languages - Turning Domain Knowledge Into Tools : http://mdebook.irisa.fr/ DSL Engineering: http://dslbook.org/ Blogs https://languageengineering.io/ License To the extent possible under law, Manuel Leduc has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this work.
